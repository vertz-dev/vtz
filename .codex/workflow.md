# Development Workflow

## Autonomous Development Loop

When assigned a feature with an implementation plan:
- Execute ALL phases sequentially without waiting for user input
- Each phase: implement → CI → self-review → fix → CI → next phase
- After all phases: push → open PR → monitor CI → rebase → ensure green → THEN stop
- **The human only sees the final PR, already reviewed and CI-green.** Do not ask for input between phases.
- If blocked (ambiguous requirement, design conflict that agents cannot resolve), ask the user — otherwise keep going

### Phase Execution

For each phase:
1. **Implement** — strict TDD (see tdd.md). One failing test → minimal code → green → refactor
2. **Quality gates** — ALL must pass before review:
   - `cargo test --all` (all crates)
   - `cargo clippy --all-targets --release -- -D warnings`
   - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
3. **Commit** — stage and commit all changes for the phase
4. **Adversarial review** — spawn 1 review agent:
   - Reviews check: delivers what ticket asks, TDD compliance, no unsafe gaps, no security issues, API matches design doc
   - Review must be adversarial — actively look for mistakes, don't rubber-stamp
5. **Fix-review loop** — repeat until all blockers and should-fix items are resolved:
   a. Fix ALL blocker and should-fix findings from the review
   b. Re-run quality gates (test + clippy + fmt)
   c. Commit the fixes
   d. If the reviewer had blockers, re-run the review on the new code
   e. If re-review finds new blockers, go back to (a)
   f. Loop exits when the reviewer approves (no remaining blockers)
6. **Push** — push the branch to origin
7. **Move to next phase** — no pause, no user prompt needed

### After All Phases

1. Rebase feature branch on latest `main` to ensure it's up-to-date
2. Run full quality gates one final time after rebase (tests, clippy, fmt)
3. Push feature branch to origin
4. Open PR to main with:
   - Public API Changes summary (breaking / deferred / additions vs design doc)
   - Summary of all phases
   - Consolidated review findings and resolutions
   - E2E acceptance test status
5. **Monitor GitHub CI** — check PR status using `gh pr checks` or `gh run list`
6. If CI fails on GitHub: diagnose, fix locally, push, and monitor again. Repeat until green.
7. If `main` has advanced since the PR was opened: rebase, re-run quality gates, force-push, monitor CI again.
8. **STOP only when GitHub CI is green and the PR is ready for review** — notify the human that the PR is ready for their review and manual merge.

## Branch Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/<name>` | `feat/plugin-system` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<name>` | `fix/timer-cancel` |
| Improvement | `chore/<name>` | `chore/clippy-warnings` |
| POC | `poc/<name>` | `poc/wasm-modules` |

## Commits

- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description> [#<ISSUE>]`
- **Author identity:** Always commit as `Vinicius Dacal <viniciusldacal@gmail.com>`. Use `--author="Vinicius Dacal <viniciusldacal@gmail.com>"` if the worktree git config has a different user. Never commit under a bot identity.
- Include `Co-Authored-By: OpenAI Codex <noreply@openai.com>` in the commit body.
- Read the GitHub issue before starting work
- Reference issue in every commit
- If commit closes issue, add `Closes #<ISSUE>` in body
- Never commit or push to main directly

## PR to Main Requirements

- Public API Changes summary (mandatory)
- E2E acceptance test passing
- All issues marked done
- Retrospective in `plans/post-implementation-reviews/`
- Human approval required

## Quality Gates (pre-push)

Before pushing ANY code:
- `cargo test --all` — tests pass
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --release -- -D warnings` — no warnings
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` — formatting clean
- Never push code that fails clippy

## Parallel Work

- Multiple agents on same repo → each uses separate git worktree
- Never work in main repo directory when other agents may be active
